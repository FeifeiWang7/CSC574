#### Points

Overwrite SEH handler

Go to ROP chain

Call VirtualAlloc to make shellcode executable

Run shellcode

#### Experiments

Run python exploit.py to get playlist

Add exploit.pls to Audio Converter

#### Design

exploit1.py - basic ROP generated by Mona
exploit2.py - fewer returns
exploit3.py - more instuctions between returns
exploit4.py - use jmps instead of returns
exploit5.py - call VirtualAlloc first time to make memory executable, and call VirtualAlloc second time to make it call-preceded and memory executable so as to pass ROPGuard
